#
#    An acronym is a word formed by taking the first letters of the words in a phrase and making a word from them. For example, RAM is an acronym for â€œRandom Access Memory."
#
#    Write a program that allows the user to type in a phrase and then outputs the acronym for that phrase.
#
#    Hint: use the function split() to get the separate words
#
#          use the slicing to get the first letter of the word
