#   Requirements: The days of the year are often numbered from 1 through 365 (or 366). This number can be computed in three steps using int arithmetic:
#                 (a) dayNum = 31(month - 1) + day
#                 (b) if the month is after February subtract (4(month) + 23)/ /10
#                 (c) if it's a leap year and after February 29, add 1
#                   
#                 Write a program that accepts a date as month/ day /year, verifies that it is a valid date (see class example), and then calculates the corresponding day number.
