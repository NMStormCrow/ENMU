#   Requirements: Write a program that computes the intersection of a circle, which the radius is r and centered at (0,0), with a horizontal line, has 
#                 a intercept (0, y). Displays the information textually and graphically.
#
#                 Do it with a graphical user interface, and add a decision to handle the case where the line does not intersect the circle.
