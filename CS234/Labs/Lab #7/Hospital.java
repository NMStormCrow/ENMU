* Requirements: Write  a  class  definition  named  Hospital  (i.e.,  .java  file  without  the  main 
                method).  
                
                You need to have one instance variable to store a hospitalâ€™s name. No extra 
                instance variables are allowed.  
                
                A given hospital does one action and is to heal patients. Therefore, you need 
                to create a non-static method that receives as parameter a patient. The method 
                needs to check the patientâ€™s health. If the health is 0 units or less, sadly, 
                the patient is dead. Otherwise, the hospital increases the patient health by 1 
                unit. The method does not return anything. 
                
                The name for each hospital is assigned in the constructor for that instance. 
                
                No extra methods are needed nor allowed.
